# OpenOmniVRInputs
Open Source Software to accept all kinds of inputs to SteamVR


The idea of this Software is to create a multi-purpose Software that can take API's from low or high cost tracking solutions (Leap Motion, Kinect, Wii Remotes, etc...) and being able to use them on the SteamVR, the idea is that with this tool, and with the most "clandestine" solutions, We can enable VR usage with them

We also have in mind ways to make older headsets (like the Oculus Development Kits) work with the current VR ecosystem.
